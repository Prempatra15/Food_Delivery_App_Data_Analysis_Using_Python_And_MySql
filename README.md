# Food-Delivery-App-Data-Analysis
#### In this project, I followed a structured approach to analyze a real-world database and extract valuable insights. Here is an overview of how I worked on this project:
#### 1) Understanding the data:  I reviewed the dataset to gain an overview of the dataset's structure, variables, and their meanings. This helped me understand the context and purpose of the data.
#### 2) Data preprocessing: To ensure the data was in a suitable format for analysis, I utilized Python for data preprocessing tasks. This involved cleaning the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and addressing any inconsistencies or outliers in the dataset. I also transformed the data by converting data types for better analysis.
#### 3) SQL queries: Using structured query language (SQL), I crafted queries to retrieve specific information from the database.
